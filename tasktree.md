# Task Tree

## Project Description
### Summary
The idea is to create an application that allows the user to track their progress on projects via a task tree.
### Problem
I find that I frequently have ideas for personal projects that I want to create and work on in my spare time, but I rarely am able to finish anything because the task always seems so daunting, or I lose motivation as the end never seems to get any closer. This application helps you define a specific list of individual tasks that you can work on in small bits of free time, and visibly shows you the progress you are making.
### Features
* Projects are defined by the user as trees of tasks.
* Composite tasks:
  * Divided into other child tasks.
  * Display a progress bar showing their percent completion based on the completion of their child tasks.
* Indivisible tasks
  * Users sets their "weight" that determines how much they contribute to the completion of the parent task
  * Completion state/value set by the user (check box, percent slider, etc.)
* Tree display and list display for project
### Code
I do not know what language or tool-sets would be used for this project. Ideally it would be a web application so that the user can access it from anywhere at any time, so TypeScript, Wordpress, React, etc.
### Audience
This application would be used by creative people of all disciplines who want to work on their own brainchild projects and need a good way to plan things out, whether its art, writing, music, coding, etc. It could even be used for more mundane tasks like doing your taxes or renovating your living room.
